        <ul>

          <p><strong>Before You Apply:</strong> Please remember that adopting an animal is a SERIOUS commitment. Animals may take <strong>several weeks to months</strong> to settle into their new environment. They cost money and require lots of attention and love. Please, seriously consider your decision to adopt. Sadly, too many animals are adopted and returned simply because folks didnâ€™t think adoption through enough. We highly suggest that you research what is best for you and plan to participate in a training course so the adoption experience is a positive and lasting one for you and the animal you adopt.</p>
