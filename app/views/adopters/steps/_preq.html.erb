        <h3>Before you begin your application</h3>
        <p>Thank you for choosing Operation Paws for Homes to adopt your rescue dog. To complete your application you will need to provide:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Three personal references, not related by blood or marriage, with phone numbers</li>
          <li>Phone number for your vet to verify current cats and dogs are spayed/neutered and up to date on shots</li>
          <li>If you rent, the phone number of your landlord to verify your pet policy</li>
        </ol>

      <h4>Privacy Information</h4>
      <p>Your personal information will not be shared with anyone outside of OPH. It will be used to help ensure each dog goes to a well-suited home. See our <a href="/terms">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

      <h4> Current Pet Owners</h4>
      <p>Your current dogs and cats must be spayed or neutered and up to date on shots.  Proof or vet verification is required.</p>

      <h4>Adopting a dog is a serious commitment.</h4>
      <p>A dog may take several weeks or months to settle into their new home, owning a dog costs money, and a dog requires lots of attention and love. Please, seriously consider your decision to adopt. Sadly, too many dogs are adopted and returned because folks donâ€™t think through adoption. We highly suggest that you <a href="/resources">research</a> what is best for you and plan to participate in a training course so the adoption experience is a positive and lasting one for you and your dog.</p>
