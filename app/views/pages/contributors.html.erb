    <h1>Sponsors and Contributors</h1>

    <p>Operation Paws for Homes is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded.
    OPH receives no funding from federal, state, or county governments.  As a result, OPH 
    Rescue relies on generous donations and the adoption fees of our dogs to help in our 
    mission of saving dogs from shelters and finding them forever homes!</p>

    <h2>Sponsors</h2>

    <p>OPH Rescue would like to express our deep gratitude to the businesses and individuals
    who support our mission by becoming OPH Sponsors!  These contributors help us to 
    save the amazing dogs we find huddled in a shelter, running out of time in a kennel run, 
    or overlooked because of their fear for being abandoned in an unknown place and give 
    them the opportunity to find caring, loving forever homes.  Saying thank you doesn’t 
    seem to be enough for the support, but we do know it is a great start!</p>

      <h2>Contributors</h2>

      <p>Many businesses and professionals give their time, space, resources and discounted 
      fees to assist us in our mission of saving dogs.  They are partners with OPH and – 
      without their support – we could not continue to rescue dogs, help find forever homes 
      for the dogs, and work to end the influx of unwanted dogs into rural shelters in the 
      South.  It’s hard to imagine how many moving parts and pieces go into a “rescue” of 
      a dog.  You have shown our rescued dogs and our team of incredible volunteers 
      that creating a village of dog lovers who will work for a common goal is something 
      obtainable!</p>
