		<h1>Sponsors and Contributors</h1>

		<p>Operation Paws for Homes is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded.
		OPH receives no funding from federal, state, or county governments.  As a result, OPH 
		Rescue relies on generous donations and the adoption fees of our dogs to help in our 
		mission of saving dogs from shelters and finding them forever homes!</p>

		<h2>Sponsors</h2>

		<p>OPH Rescue would like to express our deep gratitude to the businesses and individuals
		who support our mission by becoming OPH Sponsors!  These contributors help us to 
		save the amazing dogs we find huddled in a shelter, running out of time in a kennel run, 
		or overlooked because of their fear for being abandoned in an unknown place and give 
		them the opportunity to find caring, loving forever homes.  Saying thank you doesn’t 
		seem to be enough for the support, but we do know it is a great start!</p>

    <h3>Sporting Dog Sponsors ($1,000)</h3>

    <h3>Herding Dog Sponsors ($500)</h3>

    <h3>Working Dog Sponsors ($250)</h3>

    <h3>Hunting Dog Sponsors ($100)</h3>

    


			<h2>Contributors</h2>

			<p>Many businesses and professionals give their time, space, resources and discounted 
			fees to assist us in our mission of saving dogs.  They are partners with OPH and – 
			without their support – we could not continue to rescue dogs, help find forever homes 
			for the dogs, and work to end the influx of unwanted dogs into rural shelters in the 
			South.  It’s hard to imagine how many moving parts and pieces go into a “rescue” of 
			a dog.  You have shown our rescued dogs and our team of incredible volunteers 
			that creating a village of dog lovers who will work for a common goal is something 
			obtainable!</p>


			<h3>Photographers</h3>

			<p>A special thank you to our wonderful photographers who donate their time and talent to 
			help showcase the adorableness of our pooches!  We appreciate their incredible photos 
			and know that several dogs have found forever homes thanks to their efforts! Be sure to visit Allen and Michael’s websites to see their beautiful photographs, learn 
			more about the amazing pet portraits they can create for you, and to follow their Doggie 
			Blogs.</p>
