<h1>The Adoption Process</h1>

<h2>Application</h2>
<%= image_tag("floats/smokey.jpg", :class => "floatRight") %>
<p>Each prospective adopter fills out an adoption application. The adoption application is a simple form that asks information about you and why you are looking to adopt. Essentially, this application gives us necessary information about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.</p>

<p>Click here to complete our online application. Once we receive the application, it is processed in the order that it was received.  Our volunteers will contact your personal references, veterinary reference and landlord where applicable, and ask to discuss your interest in adoption and past experiences as a pet owner.</p>

<p><strong>It is helpful if you contact your references so that they can anticipate our calls.</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind, that depending on the timing of your application, the dog you are interested in can already have multiple applications for adoption. However, rest assured that there are many dogs that need forever homes, and OPH will work with you to find you a dog that closely matches what you are looking for.</p>

<h2>Meet and Greet</h2>

<p>Once your application is approved, you will be contacted by an OPH Adoption Coordinator to schedule a “meet and greet” with the dog you are interested in. We prefer that everyone in the immediate family, including your current dog (if you have one) come to the appointment to meet your potential new family member.  Adopting a dog is a big decision and requires a commitment from everyone.  If you currently own a dog, it must be up to date on its shots and spayed/neutered.</p>

<p>Sometimes we will also conduct a home check, which is at our discretion and usually done for those first-time dog owners. Dogs from animal shelters can be amazing escape artists. By visiting your home, we can help identify potential escape routes and let you know the best way to ensure that your new friend doesn’t sneak away.</p>

<p>At the meet and greet, the foster will be able to provide you with a wealth of personality information about the dog you are interested in.  Also, this is a great opportunity for you to really assess if this is the dog for you. You will be able to interact with the dog to ensure that he/she is exactly what you want.</p>

<h2>Adoption</h2>
<p>Before you bring your new family member home, you must sign an Adoption Contract with OPH. In addition, the adoption fee is requested. Please refer to the “What the Adoption Fee Covers” link for detailed information on the fees. The adoption fee is non-refundable.</p>

<p>Please remember that adoption fees barely cover our expenses of rescuing a dog. Additional donations are greatly appreciated and will help us continue our life-saving work. </p>
 
<p>If, at the time of adoption, your dog was not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to agree to spay/neuter your dog and provide us a deposit fee. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed/neutered within 1 month of adoption or when age appropriate. Once this has been verified, your deposit check will be returned to you</p>

<h2>Follow up</h2>
<p>Our goal is to help you enjoy life with your new dog to the fullest extent possible. If issues arise, or you just need some good advice, we are happy to do follow-up counseling by telephone and email. We can also suggest dog trainers in the area as additional resources. Also, at the time of adoption, you are provided with a pamphlet full of information and links to online resources to help with behavioral related issues like potty training and house training. This information can also be accessed from the “Information” tab on the OPH home page.</p>

<h2>If Anything Prevents You From Keeping Your Dog</h2>
<p>
Sometimes situations arise which cannot be helped. If, for any reason, you are unable to keep a dog you’ve adopted from Operation Paws for Homes, <strong>the dog cannot be given away</strong>.
It doesn’t matter how much time has passed since the adoption. You must either return the dog to Operations Paws for Homes, or obtain approval from Operations Paws for Homes to transfer ownership to a friend or relative.</p>
