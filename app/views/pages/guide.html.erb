	<h1>Adoption Guide</h1>
	<p>The decision to bring a new dog into your home is a big one.  Operation Paws for Homes wants to make sure your adoption goes as smoothly as possible.  With many wonderful dogs to choose from, we’ll work with you to find a dog that is a great fit for you and your family.  All of our dogs are in foster care before adoption, helping each dog make a smooth transition into its new home.</p>
	
	<h2 id="application">Your Application</h2>
	<p>Our <a href="/adopters/new">Adoption Application</a> is designed to ensure a good match between dogs and adopters.  Before you begin the application, you’ll want to take care of the following:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><span class="label important">Important</span> Your current pets, if any, must be spayed/neutered and up-to-date on shots.</li>
		<li>If you rent, talk to your landlord about pet policies.</li>
		<li>Think of three personal references we can contact for your background check.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Once your application is submitted, our volunteers will review your application.  This review will include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Contact your landlord, if you rent</li>
		<li>Contact your Vet, if you’ve had dogs or cats in the past 10 years</li>
		<li>Interview your references</li>
		<li>Interview you</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Our approval process generally takes 2 to 7 days.  The most common delay to approving an application is being unable to reach your references. </p>
	
	<h2 id="dog">Selecting Your Dog</h2>
	
	<p>Once your application is approved, we will setup a time for you to meet the dog you want to adopt.  Our dogs are located in loving foster homes throughout Virginia, Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.   You can also attend one of our many <a href="/events">adoption events.</a></p>
	
	<p>Our lists of currently available dogs can be found on <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/VA600.html">Petfinder</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Operation-Paws-For-Homes/125971917423548">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com/cgi-bin/public/petsearch.cgi/search_pets_by_shelter?shelter_id=79954&clan=dog">Adopt a pet</a>.  We adopt each dog to the first approved and available adopter.  The dog of your choice cannot be held or reserved until after your application is approved.  If the dog you want is adopted before your application is approved, we will gladly help you select a new dog.  Generally, you will be able to finalize the adoption at the event or meeting.</p>
	
	<h2 id="fees">Adoption Fees and Contract</h2>
	
	<p>At the time of adoption, you must complete our <a href="/docs/adoption_contract.pdf">Adoption Contract</a> and provide payment of our adoption fees (check or money order). </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Adults and Young Dogs are <strong>$250 - 325</strong></li>
		<li>Puppies are <strong>$250</strong>, plus a $50 deposit refunded with proof of spay/neuter</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We are an all volunteer organization.  All proceeds go toward saving more dogs.</p>

	<h2 id="after">After Adoption</h2>
	
	<p>We hope that everything goes well for your new adoption.  However, if a medical concern arises we may be able to help. Some conditions are not observed in a foster dog until they transition to a new home. We can provide additional dewormer or antibiotics for kennel cough or other illnesses if you contact us immediately. We cannot reimburse you for vet bills or guarantee the health of a dog.</p>
	
	<h2 id="returns">Returning Your Dog</h2>
	
	<p>If anything prevents you from keeping your dog, regardless of how much time has passed since the adoption, you must contact <a href="/contact">Operation Paws for Homes.</a></p>

<p>The dog cannot be given away.  You must either return the dog to us or obtain approval to transfer ownership to a friend or relative. </p>
