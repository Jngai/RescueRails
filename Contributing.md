# Contributing to RescueRails

Thanks for your interest in the project.  RescueRails is a custom built web application built using the Ruby on Rails framework.   It serves as both the public face for Operation Paws for Homes and helps manage important information about our dogs, prospective adopters and volunteers.


If you're very new to web development or to Ruby on Rails, you'll have a lot to learn before you get started.  I recommend [learnenough.com](https://www.learnenough.com/) and [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/) as imporant first steps to complete.


Otherwise, Pull Requests are always welcome, see our [project](https://github.com/orgs/ophrescue/projects/1) for backlog items.  Please include some rspec tests to verify your work.  If you'd like to be a regular contributor and work on some of the more involved items in the backlog, please submit a volunteer application at https://ophrescue.org/volunteer.  Thanks!
